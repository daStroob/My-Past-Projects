# My-Past-Projects
<p>by Dario Strübin <br>
This Folder contains a small selection of material about four past projects of mine.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Any Robot Controller Interface:</b><br>
For my bachelor's thesis I worked on a new controller interface for the quadrupedal robot 'Anymal'. The aim was to develop an interface that was intuitive and easy to use. I started by reading papers on the topic of human-robot interaction and interface design. Then I developed a touch interface, enabling the user to access Anymal's main functionalities in an intuitive and effective manner, as well as a new widget to place individual feet of the robot on a selected location on the map.<br>
I included in this repository the written report, documenting the project and my progress.</p>

<p><b>Innovation Project 2017:</b><br>
As part of my mechanical engineering studies at ETH Zürich I participated in the innovation project together with a small team of five people. In the innovation project, over 90 teams are challenged to find the best solution for this year’s task. Therefore, we had to build a robot which can conduct research through collecting probes on a fictional asteroid. As an additional challenge, no wheeled robots were allowed.<br>
My primary responsibility was the mechatronics section and the writing of the control code in Labview.</p>

<p><b>Arcade Cabinet:</b><br>
For my graduation work at the Gymnasium I built an Arcade Cabinet. This involved planning and building the cabinet itself, connecting and reading input devices through an Arduino and programming the software and some videogames in Java.<br>
I wrote a complete documentation of the project (in German), which I included in this folder. I also included the code of the main arcade software and of the Arduino input handling.</p>

<p><b>Pixel Art Display:</b><br>
This was a private project of mine which I did for fun. I built a 16x16 pixels display to show old school pixel art. An Arduino reads sequences of images on an SD card and then displays them on multiple rows of LED-strips. The case was all built by lasercut MDF pieces and a 3D printed frame to cleanly separate the individual pixels.<br>
I also included the code which runs on the Arduino.</p>
