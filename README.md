# My-Past-Projects
<p>by Dario Strübin <br>
This Folder contains a small selection of material about five past projects of mine.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Scewo Internship</b><br>
During a six months long industrial internship at the startup company <i>Scewo</i> I worked on the development of a balancing and stairclimbing wheelchair as a software engineer. The main part of the job was contributing to the software running the wheelchair, for example the stair-detection using time of flight sensors. Besides that I developed a graphical interface in C++ and Qt to plot and display information about the wheelchair and change settings. This interface was then used by the team to help during development, testing and debugging.

<p><b>Any Robot Controller Interface:</b><br>
For my bachelor's thesis I worked on a new controller interface for the quadrupedal robot <i>Anymal</i>. The aim was to develop an interface that was intuitive and easy to use. I started by reading papers on the topic of human-robot interaction and interface design. Then I developed a touch interface, enabling the user to access Anymal's main functionalities in an intuitive and effective manner, as well as a new widget to place individual feet of the robot on a selected location on the map.<br>
I included in this repository the written report, documenting the project and my progress.</p>

<p><b>Arcade Cabinet:</b><br>
For my graduation work at the Gymnasium I built an Arcade Cabinet. This involved planning and building the cabinet itself, connecting and reading input devices through an Arduino, programming the software in Java and finally design and code some videogames.<br>
I wrote a complete documentation of the project (in German), which I included in this folder. I also included the code of the main arcade software and of the Arduino input handling.</p>

<p><b>Pixel Art Display:</b><br>
This started as a private project of mine which I did for fun. I wanted to build a small 16x16 pixels display to show old school pixel art. An Arduino inside reads sequences of images on an SD card and then displays them on multiple rows of LED-strips. The case was all built by lasercut MDF pieces and a 3D printed frame to cleanly separate the individual pixels.<br>
Later on I was asked to build a larger panel to use as prop in a short film and music video. To build this panel with a width of 1.5 meters I redesigned the frame to be built entirely by lasercutter and switched the Arduino for a Teensy, which is able to output to multiple LED-rows in parallel to handle the 36x36 pixels. Any video file could then be fed to the teensy via a usb serial connection.
I included the code which runs on the Arduino of the small panel as well as some fotos of the building process.</p>

<p><b>Innovation Project 2017:</b><br>
As part of my mechanical engineering studies at ETH Zürich I participated in the innovation project together with a small team of five people. In the innovation project, over 90 teams are challenged to find the best solution for this year’s task. Therefore, we had to build a robot which can conduct research through collecting probes on a fictional asteroid. As an additional challenge, no wheeled robots were allowed.<br>
My primary responsibility was the mechatronics section and the writing of the control code in Labview.</p>
